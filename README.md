# Manim Projects
This is my source code for projects made using 3Blue1Brown's Manim software.
In order to use these files, you will have to install manim on your computer. I do not recommend trying to learn manim from my source code, but I have tried to document my final projects.

Here is the install guide and a few getting started references for manim:
